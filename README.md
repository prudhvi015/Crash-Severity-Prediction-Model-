# Crash-Severity-Prediction-Model-

Crash severity prediction is important for factors like improving road safety, reducing injuries, and others. Building
a prediction model to accurately predict the outcomes can help the authorities and emergency responders to identify
the reasons for the increase in crash severity and provide opportunities to implement preventive measures to avoid the
crashes. Moreover, the awareness given based on the data driven insights helps in educating drivers on high-risk behav-
iors and conditions. This project builds a prediction model using machine learning, and explainable AI techniques helps to
pinpoint the factors that influence the crash severity outcomes. By combining two methods permutation importance to select
important features and counterfactual explanations to get the explanations on the outcomes obtained in the prediction. By
generating counterfactual explanations automotive experts can identify the features that need to be modified for reducing the
crash severity.
